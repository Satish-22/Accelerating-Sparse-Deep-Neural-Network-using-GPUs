Deep Neural Networks are at the heart of Machine
Learning and artificial intelligence. One cannot imagine the
impact it is having is having in the field of playing with large
data sets to gain wonderful results out of it. Past researches have
shown that sparse Deep Neural Networks perform as better as
dense DNNs with much better memory optimization and less
energy consumption . The larger the size of the data sets , the
better and efficient the result. The present computer hardware
and architecture makes it difficult to play with large datasets
owing to memory and energy utilization constraints. This
paper addresses the 2019 Sparse Deep Neural Network Graph
Challenge with an implementation of this challenge using GPU
programming model.Past solutions to this problem statement
have used GPU as a hardware tool to implement it.Earlier GPU
implementations are 4.3 times as fast as CPU implementation.
